# Dodger

This program is designed to change the hostname and MAC address of a Kali Linux machine. It will modify the hostname through the ```hostnamectl``` and update the ```/etc/hosts``` file to the new set hostname. It will then alter the MAC address using the ```macchanger``` command with the switch ```-r``` to randomize the MAC.
