# Dodger

This program is designed to change the hostname of a computer running on Kali Linux. It will modify the /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname content to alter the name of the machine. This program will require the computer to be restarted for the changes to take effect. This is one of the two steps needed to go around a Wi-Fi blacklisting you. After the computer has restarted are you ment to use the macchanger tool to completly evade the blacklist. This is meant to be used for educational purposes only!
